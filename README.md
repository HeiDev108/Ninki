# Ninki

A simple site made with Vue, Vuex, and vue-router. Axios for easy fetching data from nodejs back-end.

Updated to use serverless functions hosted with Vercel instead of nodejs server previously hosted on Heroku.

Previous versions back-end consists of firestore database for user management and comments, and ninki-api, my nodejs api to fetch spotify API chart data hosted on Heroku.

Some skills demonstrated in the app include:
- Vue Js
- VueX
- Vue Router
- Form validation
- Tailwind css
- Firebase storage
- Firestore database
- User Authentication using Firebase (JWT)
- Session storage for user authorisation
- User comments
- Serverless Functions
- Spotify API

Previously also used:
- NodeJs
- Express.js
